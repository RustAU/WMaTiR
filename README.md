We Made a Thing in ðŸ¦€

Was your NYE resolution to learn rust .. the elusive goal that never gets done ?

Or are you a seasoned veteran and some urgency and constrained focus could help ship a project ?

With some healthy peer pressure ? Or with a mentor pestering a bit ?

This is why we created WMaTiR !

Idea is to have people ship projects
